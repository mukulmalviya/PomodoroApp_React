# Tamatar 🍅 - Pomodoro App
_Productive hone ki ninja technique!_

## About App
A simple pomodoro app where you can
  1. set time for work, short break, long break.
  2. start and pause timer.

Made using purely Reactjs and CSS as a practice project.\
Inspired by Frontend mentor pomodoro app.\
Used of npm package `react-countdown-circle-timer` for timer styling.

## Plans for future
* To host it using heroku or firebase.
* To Add React states to save timer progress when switching between work and breaks. (bug ??)

## How to use 
* clone directory
* install react
* npm start inside app directory, should be available in local server 3000.

### Feel free to improve and star this project. 😁
